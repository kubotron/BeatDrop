What is Bibip?
==============

Bibip is a pleasant and meaningful vario sound. Bibip makes two beeps, not just one.

When you're flying a paraglider:

either you are climbing in rising air
or you are in sinking air, loosing height faster than usual
or you are somewhere in between, in air that is buoyant but not really climbing.
Bibip has a distinct sound sequence in each case:

When climbing (above your configured climb threshold), it is rising: "boo-bip"
In sinking air (under the configured sink threshold), the melody is falling: "bip-boo"
If buoyant (in between your lift and sink threshold), Bibip makes a flat "bip-bip"

The character of the sound in climb is different from the sinking/buoyant sound. Bibip is never quiet. The sounds are based on black piano keys, they are not configurable yet.

See the [Demo video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvPstiTeKjU) of the sound.
